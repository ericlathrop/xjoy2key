What is xjoy2key?
=================
xjoy2key maps your joystick button presses to keyboard key presses so you can
play games with a joystick that don't support one natively.


Setup and usage
===============
The first time you run xjoy2key you'll need to have it generate a configuration
file for you to edit. Plug in your joystick and run:

  xjoy2key --config /dev/input/js0 >somegame.cfg

where js0 is the device name of your joystick. Edit the file generated to change
which keyboard keys are sent for each button or axis. The line:

  axis -3 Left -32767

sets the negative end of the 3rd axis to send the keyboard's left arrow when it
reaches a value of -32767 or lower. The line:

  button 2 Shift_L

sets the 2nd button to send the keyboard's left shift key when it is pressed.
Use the jscal program to identify the buttons and axes on your joystick. (Mine
reported several phantom axes and buttons that didn't exist). Look in
/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h to find the names of the keys you can use.

Once your configuration file is set up, run:

  xjoy2key somegame.cfg

You should be able to test your configuration by opening a text editor and
pressing joystick buttons to make sure the right keys are sent.

That's it! Have fun playing your games!
